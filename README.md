# Web-Design-Challenge
My Web Design Assigment
Coding in HTML and giving format with CSS was a little different from what we learned in prior sessions. Even the code is very intuitive and much like a markdown, you must be very diligent when opening and closing tags, because you can easily be in the middle of an spaguetti code incident. It was fun though. Thanks
